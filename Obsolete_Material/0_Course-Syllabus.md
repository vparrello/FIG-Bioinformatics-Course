# Course Syllabus

## 1. Representative Genomes

1. Tab Separated Files - Programming Basics and how to read Tab Separated Value Files

2. FASTA files - Basic Bioinformatic operations on a "common denominator" format used to store and share genomic sequence data

3. Kmers and Jaccard Similarities - How Bioinformatic Scientists measure the similarity between two sequences

4. Building "Representative Sets" - In an age of millions of genomes and billions of sequences, how can we construct manageably small sets of "representatives" that capture the diversity of the full set?

## 2. Hammers

1. Hammers as Genetic Barcodes - A way to look up what a genome could be without knowing the whole thing.

2. Hammer Tuning- Determine what is important for creating a unique and useful hammer. 

3. Creation of the Hammer Set - Create your own set of hammers based on a single role

## 3. Projections

1. Sample Set Creation - Create the sample report needed to feed the hammer output into an "X-matrix"

2. Data Curation - Create the X-matrix necessary to feed into a classifier

3. Creating the Xmatrix - Create the ancilary data to make a classifier and explore the inner workings of what happens at each stage

4. Machine Learning Classifier - Validation data ensures that the classifier should work well on real-world data. Find out what quality testing you can do to make the system more accurate
